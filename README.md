BaseApp
This is a basic React Native project created using Expo CLI. The purpose of this project is to provide a clean slate to get started with React Native development using Expo.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14 or above)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Expo CLI (if you don't have it installed yet)
Install Expo CLI
If you haven't already installed Expo CLI globally, you can do so by running the following command:

npm install -g expo-cli
Getting Started
Follow these steps to create and run your new Expo project:

1. Create a New Expo Project
To create a new project, run the following command in your terminal:

expo init MyEmptyProject
During the initialization process, Expo will prompt you to choose a template. Select the "blank" template for a minimal, empty project:

? Choose a template: blank (TypeScript or JavaScript)
This will create a new folder called MyEmptyProject with the necessary configuration files for the project.

2. Navigate to the Project Folder
After the project is created, navigate to the newly created project folder:

cd MyEmptyProject
3. Start the Development Server
To start the Expo development server, run the following command:

expo start
This will open a new browser window displaying a QR code. You can scan this QR code using the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device to preview the project.

Alternatively, if you have an Android or iOS simulator set up, the project will automatically open in the emulator.

4. Open the Project in the Expo Go App
Download Expo Go on your mobile device (available on both Android and iOS).
Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code that appears in your browser.
Once the app is scanned, your new project should load on your device.

Development Workflow
Once your development server is running, you can edit the project files, and the changes will automatically reflect on the device or simulator in real-time.

Key Files and Folders
App.js: This is the main entry point of your project where the app is rendered.
assets/: A folder where you can store images and other static assets.
app.json: Configuration file for the Expo project (e.g., app name, icon, version).
Next Steps
Once your project is up and running, you can start developing your React Native app! Here are some resources to help you get started:

React Native Documentation
Expo Documentation
React Navigation (for adding navigation to your app)
Feel free to start building your app from this empty template and customize it as needed.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, try the following:

Clear the Cache: If the project doesnâ€™t load properly, try clearing the Expo cache by running:

expo start -c
Check Your Dependencies: Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly. You can run:

npm install
Restart the Development Server: If you're facing any unexpected errors, try restarting the server:

expo start
